**Finnish adblocking filter list**

This is a backup of the last version of the deleted finnish list from October 22nd, 2018.
The list's author tried to use it as a political tool and as a result of his actions, the list was removed from most adblockers. The author—not pleased by this—subsequently deleted the list and abandoned maintaining it altogether.

The controversial rules that blocked finnish labour union websites, and started the whole debackle have been removed from this version. The remaining rules have not been touched.

Import or view the list: **[https://buak.github.io/Suomilista/finnish-adblock-list.txt](https://buak.github.io/Suomilista/finnish-adblock-list.txt)**

NOTE: I will not continue updating the list. My goal was just to make it available so it can be used. If you'd like to continue maintaining this list, you are free to clone the repo and do as you wish!
